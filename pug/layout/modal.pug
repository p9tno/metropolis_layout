                            p Tiny kitchen & bath with a huge personality in Glendale.
                            p A tiny kitchen that was redone with what we all wish for storage, storage and more storage. The design dilemma was how to incorporate the existing flooring and wallpaper the client wantedâ€¨to preserve. The kitchen is a combo of both traditional and transitional element thus becoming a neat eclectic kitchen. The wood finish cabinets are natural Alder wood with a clear finish while the main portion of the kitchen is a fantastic olive-green finish for a cleaner look the countertop quartz has been used for the backsplash as well.

                            p This way no busy grout lines are present to make the kitchen feel heavier and busy. After one year we were also invited to remodel the small guest bathroom near the laundry room.

                            p With a mid-century / Asian design theme wood look large porcelain tiles and slate floor material  we create a spa feeling and a sensation of space.
